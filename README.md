# Build Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitpay/magento-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bitpay/magento-plugin)


# Description

Bitcoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for a highly resilient value transfer infrastructure, and this allows merchants to gain greater profits.

This is because there are little to no fees for transferring Bitcoins from one person to another. Unlike other payment methods, Bitcoin payments cannot be reversed, so once you are paid you can ship! No waiting days for a payment to clear.


# Requirements

* [Magento CE](http://magento.com/resources/system-requirements) 1.9.0.1 or higher. Older versions might work, however this plugin has been validated to work against the 1.9.0.1 Community Edition release.
* [GMP](http://us2.php.net/gmp) or [BC Math](http://us2.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php) PHP extensions.  GMP is preferred for performance reasons but you may have to install this as most servers do not come with it installed by default.  BC Math is commonly installed however and the plugin will fall back to this method if GMP is not found.
* [OpenSSL](http://us2.php.net/openssl) Must be compiled with PHP and is used for certain cryptographic operations.
* [PHP](http://us2.php.net/downloads.php) 5.4 or higher. This plugin will not work on PHP 5.3 and below.


# Upgrade From Plugin Version 1.x to 2.x

Very Important: You must complete remove any previous versions of the Bitpay Magento plugin before installing this new updated version. The plugin has been completely re-written to work with BitPay's new cryptographically secure RESTful API and will conflict with any previous plugin versions which use the old API.  To help you remove the old plugin files from your system, we have created a convenient shell script for Unix/Linux/Mac OS systems which will scan your webserver for these older files and delete them.  You may also remove these files by hand of course and the complete list of the files can be found in the source of the script for your convenience.  You can download this delete script here:  [scripts/delete.sh](https://github.com/bitpay/magento-plugin/blob/master/scripts/delete.sh).

To use this script, simply download to your server and execute the script from a shell.  You may have to mark the script executable before first use.

```sh
chmod +x delete.sh
./delete.sh
```


# Installation

Goto [http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/bitpay-payment-method.html](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/bitpay-payment-method.html) and click the *Install Now* link which will give you the *Extension Key* needed for the next step.

Once you have the key, log into you Magento Store's Admin Panel and navigate to **System > Magento Connect > Magento Connect Manager**.

***NOTE*** It may ask you to log in again using the same credentials that you use to log into the Admin Panel.

All you need to do is paste the extension key and click on the *Install* button.

***WARNING*** It is good practice to backup your database before installing extensions. Please make sure you Create Backups.

***NOTE*** These files can also up uploaded using the *Magento Connect Manager* that comes with your Magento Store

***WARNING*** It is good practice to backup your database before installing extensions. Please make sure you Create Backups.


## modman

Using [modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman) you can install the BitPay Magento Plugin. Once you have modman installed, run `modman init` if you have not already done so. Next just run `modman clone https://github.com/bitpay/magento-plugin.git` in the root of the Magento installation. In this case it is `/var/www/magento`.


# Configuration

Configuration can be done using the Administrator section of your Megento store. Once Logged in, you will find the configuration settings under **System > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods**.

![BitPay Magento Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitpay/magento-plugin/master/docs/MagentoSettings.png "BitPay Megento Settings")

Here your will need to create a [pairing code](https://bitpay.com/api-tokens) using your BitPay merchant account. Once you have a Pairing Code, put the code in the Pairing Code field. This will take care of the rest for you.

***NOTE*** Pairing Codes are only valid for a short period of time. If it expires before you get to use it, you can always create a new one an use the new one.

***NOTE*** You will only need to do this once since each time you do this, the extension will generate public and private keys that are used to identify you when using the API.

You are also able to configure how BitPay's IPN (Instant Payment Notifications) changes the order in your Magento store.

# Usage

Once enabled, your customers will be given the option to pay with Bitcoins. Once they checkout they are redirected to a full screen BitPay invoice to pay for the order.

As a merchant, the orders in your Magento store can be treated as any other order. You may need to adjust the Invoice Settings depending on your order fulfillment.

# Troubleshooting

1. Ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed on your server. Also ensure your root CA cert is updated. If your CA cert is not current, you will see curl SSL verification errors.
2. Verify that your web server is not blocking POSTs from servers it may not recognize. Double check this on your firewall as well, if one is being used.
3. Check the `payment_bitpay.log` file for any errors during BitPay payment attempts. If you contact BitPay support, they will ask to see the log file to help diagnose the problem.  The log file will be found inside your Magento's `var/log/` directory. ***NOTE*** You will need to enable the debugging setting for the extension to output information into the log file.
4. Check the version of this plugin against the official plugin repository to ensure you are using the latest version. Your issue might have been addressed in a newer version! See the [Releases](https://github.com/bitpay/magento-plugin/releases) page or the Magento Connect store for the latest version.
5. If all else fails, send an email describing your issue **in detail** to support@bitpay.com

***TIP***: When contacting support it will help us is you provide:

* Magento CE Version (Found at the bottom page in the Administration section)
* Other extensions you have installed

* Configuration settings for the extension (Most merchants take screen grabs)
* Any log files that will help
